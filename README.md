This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic problems from **[Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/)** (formerly known as URI Online Judge).

## 🎯 Objective
The main goal of this project is to improve my logic, problem-solving skills, and proficiency in **C#** and **.NET**.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** C#
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2022
- **Framework:** .NET (Console Application)

## 📂 Structure
The solutions are organized by the problem ID. For example:
- `1000.cs` refers to the "Hello World!" problem.
- `1001.cs` refers to the "Extremely Basic" problem.

## 🚀 How to run
Since this project contains multiple entry points (Main methods) for different problems:
1. Copy the code from the specific problem file (e.g., `1000.cs`).
2. Paste it into the `Program.cs` or the main execution file of your console application.
3. Run the project.

## 📝 Disclaimer
These solutions are for educational purposes. If you are solving these problems yourself, try to solve them on your own before looking at the code!
